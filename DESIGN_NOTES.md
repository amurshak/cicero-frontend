# Cicero Frontend Design Notes

## 🎨 Design Decisions & Implementation

### Minimal Chat Interface Design

Based on the provided reference (DOGEai screenshot), we've implemented a clean, minimal chat interface that follows these design principles:

#### 🔍 Reference Analysis
- **Clean header** with branding and minimal navigation
- **Centered main prompt** as the focal point
- **Suggested prompts** as clickable cards/buttons
- **Bottom-fixed input** for immediate interaction
- **Lots of whitespace** for focus and clarity

#### 🌙 Our Dark Theme Adaptation

**Header Design:**
- Cicero logo with blue accent (Scale icon)
- Minimal user avatar and menu
- Responsive mobile hamburger menu
- Maintains glassmorphism subtle transparency

**Main Content:**
- Large, centered headline: "What legislative **information** do you need?"
- Blue accent on "information" for brand consistency
- Subtitle explaining the scope of queries
- 6 suggested prompts in 2-column grid (mobile stacks to 1-column)

**Suggested Prompts:**
```
"What's in H.R. 1?"
"Tell me about recent healthcare legislation"  
"How many bills did Congress pass this year?"
"Give me 3 recent bills"
"What committees handle immigration?"
"Show me voting records on climate bills"
```

**Chat Input:**
- Fixed at bottom with backdrop blur effect
- Glassmorphism styling (subtle transparency)
- Send button with blue accent
- Keyboard shortcut (Enter to send)
- Usage indicator showing subscription tier

### 🔄 Navigation Flow

```

```
